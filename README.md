# conway-piston
Conway's Game of Life using Piston

### Controls:
* Esc => Exit
* R => Reset to previous seed
* G => New random seed

### Todo: 
* ~~Change all vectors to arrays to take advantage of stack vs heap allocation~~ (Breaks far too much)
* ~~Parallel Checking~~
* Saving and reading seeds
* Seed editing mode?

Uses MattWoelk's snake-piston and xairy's rust-sudoku as a general template (piston examples aren't very good)
